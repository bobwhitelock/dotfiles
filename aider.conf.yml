# Note: Models from GitHub Copilot need to be prefixed with `openai/` to use,
# even if not from OpenAI, as this uses an OpenAI-style endpoint.
#
# Run `gh_copilot_available_models` to see our currently available models.
#
# Can also run
# ```
# yaml_to_json .../polyglot_leaderboard.yml | \
#   jq '[.[] | select(.seconds_per_case < 30 and
#       (.command | contains("openrouter") | not))] | sort_by(.pass_rate_2)'
# ```
# to see models I might be able to use, that are not too slow, by speed at
# Aider benchmark (but also take with a pinch of salt - a lot of people think
# Sonnet 4 is better than 3.7, but it's not better on the leaderboard)

# XXX BW 2025-10-02: All this comment is outdated - update
# Current selected default model is GPT-4.1 from Azure. Other notable options
# for reference:
# - Listed Gemini model is much slower to respond but performs better on
# https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/.
# - GPT-4.1 is:
#   - Slightly faster from Azure vs Copilot;
#   - cheaper/already built-in to price from Copilot;
#   - has much lower context window limit from Copilot (64,000; Azure GPT-4.1
#   limit is the full 1 million).

# When using Azure models you need to explicitly specify `weak-model` to the

# will assume a model to use that you don't have deployed.

# Aider doesn't know about all GitHub Copilot models because of the `openai/`
