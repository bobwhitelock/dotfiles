# Note: Models from GitHub Copilot need to be prefixed with `openai/` to use,
# even if not from OpenAI, as this uses an OpenAI-style endpoint.
#
# Run `gh_copilot_available_models` to see our currently available models.
#
# Current selected default model is GPT-4.1 from Azure. Other notable options
# for reference:
# - Listed Gemini model is much slower to respond but performs better on
# https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/.
# - GPT-4.1 is:
#   - Slightly faster from Azure vs Copilot;
#   - cheaper/already built-in to price from Copilot;
#   - has much lower context window limit from Copilot (64,000; Azure GPT-4.1
#   limit is the full 1 million).
