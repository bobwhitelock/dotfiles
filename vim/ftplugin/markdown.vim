" Convert a regular markdown bullet to a checkbox. Note:
"
" - Use `>>0f-<<2h` to find first `-` in line and position cursor on this;
"   can't just `0f` as this won't work if the first char is `-`.
"
" - Use `4l` to negate the `a [ ]`, so cursor moved back to same original
"   position.
" XXX Doesn't work if line is not already a bullet.
